# burnout-support-prompts
This repository showcases AI prompt engineering work focused on mental health and burnout recovery. It includes experiments with LLMs (e.g., GPT-4), RAG workflows, and user-centered design to improve emotional support, personalization, and user engagement. Built as part of my Bonsai Prompt Design Fellowship application.
