# burnout-support-prompts
This repository includes sample burnout-related AI prompts written in Python and structured for mental health support. These prompts are optimized for GPT-4 and designed to foster reflection, self-awareness, and emotional resilience.
The code simulates user-facing prompt delivery in wellness apps and aligns with my application for the Bonsai AI Prompt Design Fellowship.
